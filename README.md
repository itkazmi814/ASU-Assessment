# ASU-Assessment

## Instructions

* Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* Run "npm install" in a command line tool.

# Part 1 
* Run "node codingAssessmentPart1" to begin the program.
* Follow instructions on the screen. Enter order amounts as integers.

# Part 2
* Run "node codingAssessmentPart2" to begin the program.
* Please note the commented code 54-56.

# Part 3
* Run "node codingAssessmentPart3 [file path to CSV file of orders here]" to begin the program.
* Code for part 3 has been much more heavily commented than other parts.
* Please note the identified improvement to be done on line 117.
* Test cases using a formal testing framework was not performed, as this is not something I have been introduced to in the past. 
     * I plan to implement Jasmine.js as a testing framework shortly, but did not do so due to allotted time constraints.
     * Current testing is done using the console to verify expected output and changes.
     * Additionally, left console.logs used in testing/writing the code to help show testing methedology and thought process. In parts 1 and 2, these console.logs were removed prior to submission.
* Improvements and incompleted features pointed out will be worked on and then submitted with the note that they took longer than the expected time.
